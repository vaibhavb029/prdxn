Instagram Gallery is an easy way to display your Instagram pictures on the website.

== Description ==

Easy and simple way to display your Instagram images on the website.
Display pictures from Instagram account as Gallery or as Carousel Slider. There is no need to configure APIs or login anywhere, just paste your Instagram Username or Tagname and configure your settings.
it's a game of few seconds and your pictures will be on the website.

**Demo:** you can see demo [Here](https://www.karansingh.ml/public/demo/insta-gallery/) or check 'screenshots' section below.

**How to use:** add new gallery in plugin setting panel and copy/paste the generated shortcode in the pages/posts content OR you can use the 'Instagram Gallery' Widget within widget section. 


== Installation ==


= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.8+
* PHP version 5.3+


= How to Install =

Upload and install in the same way you'd install any other plugin OR see [HERE](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins)


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why my pictures are not showing on page? =

profile needs to be publicly visible to show pictures.

= Can i add same Shortcode twice on a page? =

Yes, but sometimes it can conflicts with each other. So, try to create new gallery with same setting and add them.

= Can i display pictures by using Tagname? =

Yes you can.

= How to add Gallery to Widget? =

goto to plugin panel and add new gallery, then goto widgets, add Instagram Gallery widget and select the Gallery item from dropdown list.

= Why there are two popups on image click? =

there may be some other plugins(like: fancybox) which also uses image links to open popup. try to disable popup images option in the setting panel of this plugin, which will allow other plugins to work.

= Error: No working transports found =

this error visible sometimes in PHP 7+ installations due to the missing CURL extension.
